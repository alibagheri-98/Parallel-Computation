# Parallel Computing
This repository features my implementation of Parallel Algorithms with CUDA, which was my project for the 'Parallel Programming' course taught by Dr. Hashemi at Sharif University of Technology in Spring 2021.

List of implemented algorithms:
> 1. Block Matrix Multiplication (Tiled approach)
> 2. Blelloch Scan (Prefix Sum)
> 3. Merge sort algorithm

```
Let me know if you have any way to improve them.
